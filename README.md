# PROGRESS BINAURAL APP PWA

This app's intention is to port the former Mind Body Medicine cordova app to a PWA for easier maintenence and deployment.

This project has been containerized in Docker for development and deployed on App engine with TravisCI

To run in development: 
1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose up`
3. Navigate to localhost:3000

# Local development

New dependencies can be installed with npm. As the docker container attempts to mirror the current directory for hot-reloading with volumes, local installation with `npm install` will also have to be executed in the container.

To exec into a container use the following command : `docker exec -it <Container_id> sh`

This project uses service workers to cache offline data. 

Service workers are not enabled on localhost by default.
To test service worker configurations locally, execute the following commands: 

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm install --global serve`
3. `serve -s build`

This will allow you to test your production build configuraiton using the serve library. 
If you'd rather not install the package, you can opt to serve the build folder with a different webserver. 

Ensure to navigate to localhost:xxxx in an incognito window

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
